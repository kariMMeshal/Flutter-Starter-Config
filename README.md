Flutter Starter Config
A comprehensive starter configuration for Flutter projects, designed for large applications. This setup includes a professional folder structure, light and dark theme support, and reusable helper functions, constants, and utility classes.

Features
Professional Folder Structure: Organized folders for better scalability and maintainability.
Light & Dark Theme Setup: Includes configurations for themes with custom styles for buttons, text fields, app bar, chips, and more.
Helper Functions and Utility Classes: Common utility functions and helper classes are pre-built for easy access and reuse across the app.
Folder Structure

bash
Copy code
lib/
├── constants/    # Global constants (e.g., colors, typography)
├── helpers/      # Helper functions (e.g., validators, formatters)
├── themes/       # Light and dark mode theme files
├── utils/        # Utility classes (e.g., APIs, storage)
